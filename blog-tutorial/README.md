# Remix Indie Stack

## Todo

Update/Delete posts: make an /admin/$slug.tsx page for your posts. This should open an edit page for the post that allows you to update the post or even delete it. The links are already there in the sidebar but they return 404! Create a new route that reads the posts, and puts them into the fields. All the code you need is already in app/routes/posts/$slug.tsx and app/routes/posts/admin/new.tsx. You just gotta put it together.

Optimistic UI: You know how when you favorite a tweet, the heart goes red instantly and if the tweet is deleted it reverts to empty? That's Optimistic UI: assume the request will succeed, and render what the user will see if it does. So your homework is to make it so when you hit "Create" it renders the post in the left nav and renders the "Create a New Post" link (or if you add update/delete do it for those too). You'll find this ends up being easier than you think even if it takes you a second to arrive there (and if you've implemented this pattern in the past, you'll find Remix makes this much easier). Learn more from the Optimistic UI guide.

Authenticated users only: Another cool bit of homework you could do is make it so only authenticated users can create posts. You've already got authentication all set up for you thanks to the Indie Stack. Tip, if you want to make it so you're the only one who can make posts, then simply check the user's email in your loaders and actions and if it's not yours redirect them somewhere ðŸ˜ˆ

Customize the app: If you're happy with tailwind, keep it around, otherwise, check the styling guide to learn of other options. Remove the Notes model and routes, etc. Whatever you want to make this thing yours.

Deploy the app: Check the README of your project. It has instructions you can follow to get your app deployed to Fly.io. Then you can actually start blogging!

## remix-run form validation

I tried: https://www.remix-validated-form.io/

```html
<form name = "simpleForm" action = "#" onsubmit = "return validateForm()" >
  <input type = "text" name = "name" required />
</form>
```

Zod is good! (https://www.remix-validated-form.io/zod-form-data)

I don't like the way you need to create a child component for each form field if you want to use the hook to get validation errors!

## Development

- Initial setup: _If you just generated this project, this step has been done for you._

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`

### Relevant code:

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)

## Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments.

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

- Sign up and log in to Fly

  ```sh
  fly auth signup
  ```

  > **Note:** If you have more than one Fly account, ensure that you are signed into the same account in the Fly CLI as you are in the browser. In your terminal, run `fly auth whoami` and ensure the email matches the Fly account signed into the browser.

- Create two apps on Fly, one for staging and one for production:

  ```sh
  fly create blog-tutorial-326a
  fly create blog-tutorial-326a-staging
  ```

  - Initialize Git.

  ```sh
  git init
  ```

- Create a new [GitHub Repository](https://repo.new), and then add it as the remote for your project. **Do not push your app yet!**

  ```sh
  git remote add origin <ORIGIN_URL>
  ```

- Add a `FLY_API_TOKEN` to your GitHub repo. To do this, go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

- Add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

  ```sh
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app blog-tutorial-326a
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) --app blog-tutorial-326a-staging
  ```

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/generate-password) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

- Create a persistent volume for the sqlite database for both your staging and production environments. Run the following:

  ```sh
  fly volumes create data --size 1 --app blog-tutorial-326a
  fly volumes create data --size 1 --app blog-tutorial-326a-staging
  ```

Now that everything is set up you can commit and push your changes to your repo. Every commit to your `main` branch will trigger a deployment to your production environment, and every commit to your `dev` branch will trigger a deployment to your staging environment.

### Connecting to your database

The sqlite database lives at `/data/sqlite.db` in your deployed application. You can connect to the live database by running `fly ssh console -C database-cli`.

### Getting Help with Deployment

If you run into any issues deploying to Fly, make sure you've followed all of the steps above and if you have, then post as many details about your deployment (including your app name) to [the Fly support community](https://community.fly.io). They're normally pretty responsive over there and hopefully can help resolve any of your deployment issues and questions.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Cypress

We use Cypress for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in the `cypress` directory. As you make changes, add to an existing file or create a new file in the `cypress/e2e` directory to test your changes.

We use [`@testing-library/cypress`](https://testing-library.com/cypress) for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e:dev` which will start the dev server for the app as well as the Cypress client. Make sure the database is running in docker as described above.

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go through the login flow:

```ts
cy.login();
// you are now logged in as a new user
```

We also have a utility to auto-delete the user at the end of your test. Just make sure to add this in each test file:

```ts
afterEach(() => {
  cy.cleanupUser();
});
```

That way, we can keep your local db clean and keep your tests isolated from one another.

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
